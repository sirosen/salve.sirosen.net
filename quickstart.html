<p>This quick-start guide is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
It gives only the most cursory explanation of SALVE is targetted at those who like to teach themselves and learn from examples.</p>

<h1><a name="fork" class="anchor" href="#fork"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Fork SALVE</h1>

<p>The recommended way to use SALVE is to fork it and layer your own configuration on top of it.
By doing this, it becomes possible to pull in upstream changes from the stable branch of SALVE.</p>

<h2><a name="fork-with-github" class="anchor" href="#fork-with-github"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fork With GitHub</h2>

<p>The easiest way to fork SALVE is to use GitHub's built-in forking utilities.
Navigate to SALVE's page on GitHub, using the button in the upper-right corner of this page, and click the "Fork" button.
This will create a new fork, in which you can start placing your own configuration.</p>

<h2><a name="fork-manual" class="anchor" href="#fork-manual"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>... Or Fork Manually</h2>

<p>If you don't use GitHub or don't like it's forking utility, you can always do this by cloning the SALVE repo by running</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sirosen/SALVE my-config</code></pre>

<p>where "my-config" is the name you want to give to your local fork.
Push this to any remotes you like to use; Bitbucket, GitHub, and other free git servers are recommended.</p>

<h2><a name="fork-add-upstream" class="anchor" href="#fork-add-upstream"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Add 'upstream' to Fork</h2>

<p>Whatever method you chose to fork the repository, you should add a remote to at least one of your copies of it pointing to the GitHub SALVE repository.
The name 'upstream' is common among git users, so we will assume that is the name you choose.
Run</p>

<pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/sirosen/SALVE.git</code></pre>

<p>to add the 'upstream' remote.</p>

<p>The great advantage of adding upstream is that you can periodically pull in changes to SALVE.
Either a specific release can be specified, as in <code>git pull upstream 1.0.1</code>, or you can pull the latest version with <code>git pull upstream stable</code>.
If you like to live on the bleeding edge, <code>git pull upstream dev</code> is available, and may have newer features than stable, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly.
Pulling in changes directly from dev is strong dis-recommended.</p>

<h1><a name="add-bashrc" class="anchor" href="#add-bashrc"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 2: Add Your Bashrc</h1>

<p>These steps work with any file of your choice, but your bashrc is a good example of a file that should be managed with SALVE.</p>

<p>First, add your bashrc file to your repository.
It is good practice to keep your files separate from the SALVE source and tests, to avoid merge conflicts with the upstream versions.
A top-level 'files' directory is a good choice.
In your shell, inside of the repository root,</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p files/bash
cp ~/.bashrc files/bash/bashrc</code></pre>

<p>Now, add a manifest, metaconfiguration that describes where the bashrc file goes on your system.</p>

<pre><code>echo "file {
source files/bash/bashrc
target $HOME/.bashrc
action copy
}" > bash.manifest</pre></code>

<p>Finally, add these files to your git repository.
<code>git commit -am "Adding bashrc and bash manifest."</code>
Push to any remotes you use, and you are now ready to deploy your bashrc with SALVE.</p>

<h1><a name="deploy" class="anchor" href="#deploy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 3: Deploy</h1>

<p>The final step is to deploy your bashrc using SALVE.
Since SALVE automagically backs up files that it overwrites, you can always recover the older bashrc file after you deploy.
On a machine that you want to deploy your managed bashrc to, ensure that you have python 2.7 or later and run</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://my-remote/my-config
./my-config/salve.py deploy -m my-config/bash.manifest</code></pre>

<p>SALVE will take care of the rest.
If you ever need to recover from the backups, they should be located in <code>$HOME/.salve/backups</code> and logged in <code>$HOME/.salve/backup.log</code>.</p>
