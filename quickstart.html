    Step 1: Install SALVE
</h1>

<p>The recommended way to use SALVE is to fork it and layer your own configuration on top of it.
By doing this, it becomes possible to trivially pull in upstream changes from the stable branch or release versions of SALVE.
It also guarantees that whenever you put your configuration onto a machine, you
will be able to deploy it with SALVE.</p>

<p>However, if you want to get started as quickly as possible, you should just
install the latest stable version through <code>easy_install</code> or
<code>pip</code>.
You can look into forking the repo or handling inclusion of the SALVE source
with your configuration by other means in the future.
By way of example, you can install with pip:</p>

<pre><code>pip install salve</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must install salve on the machine that will be the target of
your deployment, not necessarily the machine on which you are writing your
manifests.</p>

    Step 2: Add Your Bashrc
</h1>

<p>These steps work with any file of your choice, but a bashrc is a good example of a file that should be managed with SALVE.
You can use SALVE with any VCS, but we will assume that you have chosen
<code>git</code> because of the numerous high-profile free-hosting options.</p>

<p>First, add your bashrc file to your repository.
If you have forked SALVE, it is good practice to keep your files separate from the SALVE source and tests, to avoid merge conflicts with the upstream versions.
To do this, we recommend using a top-level directory named "files".
In your shell, inside of the repository root,</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p files/bash
cp ~/.bashrc files/bash/bashrc</code></pre>

<p>Now, add a manifest, metaconfiguration that describes where the bashrc file goes on your system.</p>

<pre><code>echo 'file {
source "files/bash/bashrc"
target "$HOME/.bashrc"
action "copy"
}' > bash.manifest</pre></code>

<p>Finally, add these files to your git repository.
<code>git commit -am "Adding bashrc and bash manifest."</code>
Push to any remotes you use, and you are now ready to deploy your bashrc with SALVE.</p>

    Step 3: Deploy
</h1>

<p>The final step is to deploy your bashrc using SALVE.
Since SALVE automagically backs up files that it overwrites, you can always recover the older bashrc file after you deploy.
Just run</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://my-remote/my-config
salve deploy --manifest my-config/bash.manifest</code></pre>

<p>SALVE will take care of the rest.
If you ever need to recover from the backups, they should be located in
<code>$HOME/.salve/backups/files</code> and logged in
<code>$HOME/.salve/backup.log</code>.
Backed up files are named by a sha512 hash of their contents, but the backup
log records the original locations of the backup file copies.</p>
