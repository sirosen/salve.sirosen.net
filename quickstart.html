    Step 1: Install SALVE
</h1>

<p>The quickest and easiest way to get a version of SALVE to play with is to
install the latest stable version from
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/">PyPi</a>.</p>
<code>easy_install</code> should work, but <code>pip</code> is recommended.</p>

<pre><code>pip install salve</code></pre>

<p>Note that you must install salve on the machine that will be the target of
your deployment, not necessarily the machine on which you are writing your
manifests.</p>

    Step 2: Add Your Bashrc
</h1>

<p>These steps work with any file of your choice, but a bashrc is a good
example of a file that should be managed with SALVE.</p>

<p>In your shell, inside of the repository root,</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p bash
cp ~/.bashrc bash/bashrc</code></pre>

<p>Now, add a manifest, metaconfiguration that describes where the bashrc file goes on your system.</p>

<pre><code>echo 'file {
source "bash/bashrc"
target "$HOME/.bashrc"
action "copy"
}' > bash.manifest</pre></code>

<p>SALVE works on any VCS, but we will assume that you are using <code>git</code>.
So, add these files to your local repository.
<code>git commit -am "Adding bashrc and bash manifest."</code>
Push to any remotes you use, and you are now ready to deploy your bashrc with SALVE.</p>

    </a>
    Step 3: Deploy
</h1>

<p>The final step is to deploy your bashrc using SALVE.
Since SALVE automagically backs up files that it overwrites if it has read
access, you can recover the older bashrc file after you deploy, if necessary.
Just run</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://my-remote/my-config
salve deploy --manifest my-config/bash.manifest</code></pre>

<p>SALVE will take care of the rest.
If you ever need to recover from the backups, they should be located in
<code>$HOME/.salve/backups/files</code> and logged in
<code>$HOME/.salve/backup.log</code>.
Backed up files are named by a sha512 hash of their contents, but the backup
log records the original locations of the backup file copies.</p>
