<p>SALVE is a language -- and an in-memory compiler for that language -- for deploying configuration files.
It's purpose is to make it simple to keep configuration versioned in a VCS, then deploy it in a UNIX filesystem.</p>

<p>A SALVE repository holds the full source for SALVE, any configuration files, and a set of Manifest files.
Manifests are lists of</p>

<ul>
<li>Files and directories with destinations, ugo permissions, owner, and group</li>
<li>Other manifests, excluding the current manifest and its ancestors (i.e. no loops allowed)</li>
</ul><p>Typically, a SALVE repository also holds one root manifest, which lists all of the other manifests to be used.</p>

<p>SALVE is the Simple And Local Versioning Ecosystem.</p>

<p>Simple, because it aims to be 100% understandable.
Any manifest can be reasoned about as a sequential execution of commands.</p>

<p>Local, because it does not involve a centralized configuration server.</p>

<p>Versioning, because it is designed to operate on version controlled configuration.</p>

<p>Ecosystem, because it is designed to manage configuration for any purpose on your system, ranging from personalized config files (bashrc, emacs config), to system wide properties (nginx site files, init scripts).</p>
