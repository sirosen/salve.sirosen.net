    What is SALVE?
</h1>

<p>SALVE is a language -- and an interpreter for that language -- for deploying configuration files.
It's purpose is to make it simple to keep configuration versioned in a VCS, then deploy it in a UNIX filesystem.</p>

<p>A SALVE repository holds your configuration files, and a set of Manifest files.
Manifests are lists of</p>

<ul>
<li>Files and directories with destinations, ugo permissions, owner, and group</li>
<li>Other manifests, excluding the current manifest and its ancestors (i.e. no loops allowed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Typically, a SALVE repository also holds one root manifest, which lists all of the other manifests to be used.</p>
